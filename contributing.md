# How to contribute an example

Hi there. So glad you're wanting to contribute!

This collection of patterns submitted by ampersand users, and curated by the core team.

We want a really broad range of examples to show ampersand's flexibility!

To make sure your efforts are not wasted, we suggest you file an issue first describing what you're planning on submitting.

Also, in order to keep them as digestible and usable as possible here's a few rough guidelines.

The examples should:

1. Live in their own top-level directory
2. Folder should have a descriptive name
3. Should be runnable with just `cd foldername && npm install && npm start`
4. Ideally show one pattern each.
5. Avoid introducing too many concepts at once. 
6. Have a thorough readme.md file

Some great examples could be stuff like:

- recursively nested views/models
- complex derived properties
- grunt + ampersand
- coffeescript + ampersand
- typescript + ampersand
- react + ampersand
- ampersand form examples
- using beefy with ampersand for rapid dev
- building with moonboots-hapi, moonboots-static, moonboots-express
- phonegap/cordova + ampersand
- jQuery + plugins alongside ampersand
- using ampersand with API stubs like: https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/hapi-dummy-api
- testing clientside code on the server
- showing various testing approaches for apps

Thanks!
