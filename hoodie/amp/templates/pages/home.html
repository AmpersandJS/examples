<section class="page home"><h2>Welcome to a skeleton for Learning App</h2>

  <p>If you "view source" you'll see it's 100% client rendered.</p>

  <p>Click around the site using the nav bar at the top. </p>

  <p>Things to note:
  <ul>
    <li>The url changes, no requests are made to the server.</li>
    <li>Refreshing the page will always get you back to the same page</li>
    <li>Page changes are nearly instantaneous</li>
    <li>In development mode, you don't need to restart the server to see changes, just edit and refresh if you are running "grunt watch".</li>
  </ul>
