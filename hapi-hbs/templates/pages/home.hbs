  <h2>
    Welcome to a skeleton for Ampersand test app.
  </h2>
  <p>If you "view source" you'll see it's 100% client rendered.</p>
  <p>Click around the site using the nav bar at the top.</p>
  <p>
    Things to note:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The url changes, no requests are made to the server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refreshing the page will always get you back to the same page
      </li>
      <li>
        Page changes are nearly instantaneous
      </li>
      <li>
        In development mode, you don't need to restart the server to see
        changes, just edit and refresh.
      </li>
      <li>
        In production mode, it will serve minfied, uniquely named files with
        super aggressive cache headers. To test:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          in dev_config.json set <code>isDev</code> to <code>false</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          restart the server.
        </li>
        <li>
          view source and you'll see minified css and js files with unique
          names.
        </li>
        <li>
          open the "network" tab in chrome dev tools (or something similar).
          You'll also want to make sure you haven't disabled your cache.
        </li>
        <li>
          without hitting "refresh" load the app again (selecting current URL
          in url bar and hitting "enter" works great).
        </li>
        <li>
          you should now see that the JS and CSS files were both served from
          cache without making any request to the server at all.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </p>
