# examples pattterns recipies

We're starting this collection of patterns and approaches submitted by the community for building with [Ampersand.js](http://ampersandjs.com).

Each top-level folder contains an example and a readme explaining the example.

Please see [contributing.md](contributing.md) for more details on how to contribute.

## exploring

1. Clone this repo
2. Browse the examples (each folder has one example with a readme)
3. Unless noted in readme for that example you can run any of them by doing this:
    - `cd folder-name`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
